    <h1>Teele wali Masjid</h1>
    <p>The Teele Wali Masjid, a magnificent Sunni mosque nestled along the serene banks of the River Gomti in Lucknow, stands as an architectural marvel and a symbol of religious significance. Built during the Mughal era, between 1658 and 1660 under the supervision of Fidah Khan Koka, this grand mosque reflects the essence of Mughal architecture with its impressive domes and intricate design. Its historical importance is underscored by being one of the first monuments commissioned by Emperor Aurangzeb after ascending to the throne. The mosque, also known as Jama Masjid Shahi Teela Shah Peer Muhammad Sahab Teele Wali Masjid, holds not just religious significance but also attracts pilgrims and tourists alike, gathering in large numbers during auspicious occasions like Jum-Atul-Vida, Eid-Ul-Fitr, and Eid-Ul-Adha. The adjoining shrine of Shah Peer Muhammad adds to its reverence, making the Teele Wali Masjid not just a monument but a revered spiritual hub in the heart of Lucknow.</p>
